    objects in the Newick parenthetic text format, as well as several 
    functions for command-line tree manipulation. 
    With an emphasis on speed and computational efficiency, 
    the package also includes a suite of tools for rapidly computing 
    distance matrices and building large trees using fast alignment-free 
    k-mer counting and divisive clustering techniques.
