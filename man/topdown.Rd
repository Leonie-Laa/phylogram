\title{Top down phylogenetic trees.}
\usage{
topdown(x, seeds = NULL, k = 5, residues = NULL, gap = "-",
  weighted = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a list of sequences, possibly an object of class
\code{"DNAbin"} or \code{"AAbin"}.}

\item{seeds}{an integer vector indicating which sequences should be used as
seeds for the clustering procedure (see details section).
If NULL the seeds are randomly selected from the input sequence list.}

\item{k}{integer representing the the k-mer size to be used for calculating
the distance matrix.}

\item{residues}{either NULL (default; emitted residues are automatically
detected from the sequences), a case sensitive character vector
specifying the residue alphabet, or one of the character strings
"RNA", "DNA", "AA", "AMINO". Note that the default option can be slow for
large lists of character vectors. Specifying the residue alphabet is therefore
recommended unless the sequence list is a "DNAbin" or "AAbin" object.}

\item{gap}{the character used to represent gaps in the alignment matrix
(if applicable). Ignored for \code{"DNAbin"} or \code{"AAbin"} objects.
Defaults to "-" otherwise.}

\item{weighted}{logical indicating whether the edge lengths in the
tree should correspond to the degree of relatedness
between the sequences. Defaults to TRUE (slower).}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{"dendrogram"}.

\description{
Create phylogenetic trees by successively splitting the sequence dataset
  into smaller and smaller subsets.
}
\details{
This function creates phylogenetic trees by successively splitting
  the sequence dataset into smaller and smaller subsets (a.k.a. recursive
  partitioning). This is a "top down" approach to tree-building, as
  opposed to agglomerative "bottom up" methods such as neighbour joining
  and UPGMA. It is useful for large sequence sets (> 20, 000) since the
  usual N x N distance matrix is not required (where N is the number of
  sequences). Instead, an N x log(N, 2)^2
  distance matrix is first derived from the input sequences using the
  \code{\link{mbed}} function of Blacksheilds et al. 2010 and the k-mer
  istance measure of (Edgar 2004).
  This requires substantially less memory and time. The 'embedded' sequences
  are then split recursively using the k-means (clusters = 2) technique.
