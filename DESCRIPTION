Description: Contains functions for reading, viewing and editing phylogenetic
    trees as deeply nested lists using R's 'dendrogram' object type. This enables
    users to perform both top-down and bottom-up recursive tree operations such
    as splitting and neighbor joining. For compatibility with other programs and
    packages, trees can be imported and exported in the 'Newick' 
    (a.k.a. 'New Hampshire') text format.
