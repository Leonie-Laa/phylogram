Description: A package for developing phylogenetic trees as
    deeply-nested lists known as "dendrogram" objects.
    Contains functions for conversion between "dendrogram" and
    "phylo" class objects
    (see Paradis et al (2004) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btg412>),
    as well as several tools for command-line tree
    manipulation and import/export via Newick parenthetic text.
